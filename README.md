# MEF Portfolio Visualization

*a basic data visualization built with D3*

This visualization presents the holdings and associated equity prices for the Minutemen Equity Fund's Portfolio.
The outer donut displays the breakdown by sector value weight, while the inner displays the value breakdown of the equitys covered by the currently selected sector.
Selections are apparent through black outlines on the slice. A sector and equity pairing are always defined to create rectangle key display.
