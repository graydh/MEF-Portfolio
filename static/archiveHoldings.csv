"An investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate, so that an investor's ETF shares, if or when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of an exchange traded fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus, contact your Financial Advisor or visit the fund company's website. The prospectus contains this and other information about the fund. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Special Considerations Regarding Structured Investments 
Structured Investments are complex products and may be subject to special risks, which may include, but are not limited to: loss of initial investment; issuer credit risk and price volatility resulting from any actual or anticipated changes to issuer's and/or guarantor's credit ratings or credit spreads; limited or no appreciation and limits on participation in any appreciation of underlying asset(s); risks associated with the underlying reference asset(s); no periodic payments; call prior to maturity; early redemption fees for market linked deposits; lower interest rates and/or yield compared to conventional debt with comparable maturity; unique tax implications; limited or no secondary market; and conflicts of interest due to affiliation, compensation or other factors which could adversely affect market value or payout to investors. Investors also should consider the concentration risk of owning the related security and their total exposure to any underlying asset. Structured Investments may not perform in a manner consistent with the statement product category where they appear and therefore may not satisfy portfolio asset allocation needs for that category. Accrued interest, estimated annual income and estimated yield for Structured Investments with a contingent income feature, including Range Accrual Notes and Contingent Income Notes, assume optimal performance of the underlying asset(s) and payment in full of all contingent interest. However, contingent interest is only paid if the specified accrual conditions are met during the relevant observation period. Actual accrued interest, annual income and yield will be dependent upon the performance of the underlying asset(s) and may be significantly lower than the estimates shown. For more information about the risks specific to your Structured Investments, you should contact your Financial Advisor. For important information on the risks and conflicts of interest related to structured products generally, click here or contact your Financial Advisor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
